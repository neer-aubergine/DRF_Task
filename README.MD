- virtualenv (optional but recommended)

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

cd DRF_Task
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4. Set up the database

```sh
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
### 5. Create a superuser

```sh
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
### 6. Add sample data (using Faker) -- OPTIONAL

```sh
python manage.py poplate_db
```
### 7. Run the development server

```sh
python manage.py runserver
```
The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.


### 8. Install djago-silk for live inspection/optimization of DRF -- OPTIONAL

```sh
pip install django-silk
```

In `settings.py` add the following:

```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    ...
    'silk.middleware.SilkyMiddleware',
    ...
]

INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'silk'
)
```
To enable access to the user interface add the following to your `urls.py`:

```python
urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path('silk/', include('silk.urls', namespace='silk'))
    ...
    ]
```

before running migrate:

```bash
python manage.py migrate

python manage.py collectstatic
```


Silk will automatically begin interception of requests and you can proceed to add profiling
if required. The UI can be reached at `/silk/`
